              <h3>What We Do</h3>
              <p>
                We are a non-profit organisation that provides you with targeted and up-to-date advice on how to keep your data safe whilst using your Smart Home Devices. We do this by analysing the safety and security of various popular home device products and how to protect your data/information whilst using them. We also have a News Page that keeps you up-to-date with security breaches in home device products, whilst also providing a 'Product of the Week,' showcasing a home device that we consider 'safe to use.'
                In an age where technology and software development has become so complex, we often find that we do not fully understand the capability and thus safety of the technology devices that we use every day. Consequently, our security and awareness of these devices have never been so important when it comes to protecting our data and personal information. We believe that cyber-security must be malleable to the rapid and continuous advancement of technology and the development of technological products. As such, we hope that by making users aware of how to use home devices safely, we are able to maximise the protection of privacy and data.

                  <h5>Charlotte Gurry</h5>
                  <p>
                    Charlotte's passion for technology had started from hers studies in  'MSc Electronic Security and Digital Forensics' at Middlesex University, where she developed a keen interest in Cyber security and Threat management. Her research on 'Privacy concerns in Smart Home Devices', had highlighted issues on consumer awareness when owning these devices. This in time, led to the collaborative effort for Bella and Charlotte to seek to provide ways to inform consumers. Outside of study, she enjoys travelling, cooking, and sports activities.

                <h5>Annabel Sharpe</h5>
                <p>
                  Having recently completed her masters at University College London in 'Political Analysis: Russia and Eastern Europe,' (where she also completed her BSc in Anthropology), Annabel is now beginning her career in the technology sector. She began to learn how to code at <a href="http://www.codefirstgirls.org.uk">Code First Girls</a> in February 2019 at the European Google Headquaters, where she met co-founder Charlotte Gurry. Annabel has also been a member of the <a href="http://www.fany.org.uk/">First Aid Nursing Yeomanry</a> since 2016, an all-female voluntary organisation which deploys multi-faceted rapid response teams to support civil and military authorities in times of crisis. This sparked her interest in security and defence, as well as her mission to promote a more signifanct female presence in the security sector.

          <h6>Our Vision</h6>
          <p>
            Co-founders Annabel Sharpe and Charlotte Gurry met in February 2019 at the European Google Headquarters, which was hosting the <a href="https://www.codefirstgirls.org.uk">Code First Girls</a> coding course that they were attending: an all-female social enterprise that is helping to close the gender gap in the technology industry. The number of women working in technology is significantly lower than in other sectors in the UK, and we believe that this has to change. Our vision and aim is to inspire other women to enter into the technology industry and to use their entrepreneurial skills to create new ideas and help to expand the continuously-evolving world of tech.
